# Projects
All the projects I worked on over the past few years
Project 1: A research project where I took data about European countries plane emissions for multiple years and analyzed trends in it. Skills that were used: basic python concepts (for loops, dictionaries, lists) along with matplotlib. The research paper associated with this project is attached as well. 

Project 2: A research project where I took data about all 32 NFL teams and tried to answer the question of "Can NFL statistics help predict the number of wins a team will have in the future?" Some of the techniques used was: linear regression, logistic regression, Kmeans clustering, PCA analysis, matplotlib. The research paper with this paper is attached as well.
